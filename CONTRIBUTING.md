Contributing to JACS
===============
All contributions are welcome to be submitted for review for inclusion in the JACS scripts library, but before they will be accepted, we ask that you follow these simple steps:

1) Be sure to follow similar naming conventions for files and application names
* CamelCase for easy readability
* Proper use of JApplicationCLI

2) Submit your script as a pull request to be considered for inclusion

Please be patient as not all items will be tested immediately.
