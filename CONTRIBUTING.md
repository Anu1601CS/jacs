Contributing to JACS
===============
All contributions are welcome to be submitted for review for inclusion in the JACS scripts library, but before they will be accepted, we ask that you follow these simple steps:

1) Be sure to follow similar naming conventions for files and application names
  * CamelCase for easy readability
  * Proper use of JApplicationCLI

2) Keep application to a single file with filename the same as the function

3) Submit your script as a pull request to be considered for inclusion

And of course, please be patient as not all items will be tested immediately and it may take us a little time to review each item.

## Joomla Contributor Agreement

Ideally, everybody who contributes to the Joomla Framework, or any other Open Source Matters supported project for that matter, should sign a [Joomla Contributor Agreement](http://developer.joomla.org/contributor-agreements.htm) (JCA). 

But, we are aware that some contributors will not want to take the extra effort, especially for one-time contributors of modest amounts of code.  As a compromise, the Joomla Project requires a JCA from anybody who makes a significant contribution to Joomla or any other OSM project.  "Significant" is, of course, a judgment call.  As a general guideline, if you as an individual have contributed or intend to contribute over 100 lines of code to the Joomla Framework, we need a JCA. 

If you are contributing as an employee of a company (that is, the work you are contributing was done on company time) then we need a JCA with your company no matter how small the contribution is.
