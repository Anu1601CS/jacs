Contributing to JACS
===============
All contributions are welcome to be submitted for review for inclusion in the JACS scripts library, but before they will be accepted, we ask that you follow these simple steps:

1) Be sure to follow similar naming conventions for files and application names
  * CamelCase for easy readability
  * Proper use of JApplicationCLI

2) Keep application to a single file with filename the same as the function

3) Submit your script as a pull request to be considered for inclusion

And of course, please be patient as not all items will be tested immediately and it may take us a little time to review each item.
